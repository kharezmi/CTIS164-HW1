# CTIS164-HW1
Fast Rocket Model Homework-1 CTIS 164


This is my CTIS-164 (Technical Mathematic) homework written in C/C++ using openGL and GLUT libraries.  

Based on the example shared by the instructor, we had to code an object(car, ship, rocket, plane using geometrical shapes) to make them move in vertical or horizontal ways. If you want to run on the Linux, we make sure add "#include <strarg.h>" file.
